set view = 1

fill both buffers with terrain, set both buffer's (current_buffer_horizontal_value) to starting location horizontal_value

the loop
	iterate each object:
		foreach
			storing info required to erase just-drawn sprite
			check what it's doing
			move it, transform it, animate it as required
		next
		
	check keypresses
	
	if scroll, set target-horizontal-value
	
	if current_buffer_horizontal-value != target-horizontal-value: (we're scrolling!)
		(disable int)
		gosub do_scroll (which updates the current_buffer_horizontal-value
		gosub draw_sprites
		(enable int)
	else
		gosub erase_old_sprites
		gosub draw_sprites
	endif
	
	wait for interrupt, which will toggle viewbuff and drawbuff
goto loop
